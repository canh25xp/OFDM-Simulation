An OFDM system is successfully simulated using Python and Jupyter notebook in this project. All major components of an OFDM system are covered. This has demonstrated the basic concept and feasibility of OFDM, which was thoroughly described and explained in Chapter 3 of this report. Some of the challenges in developing this OFDM simulation program were carefully matching steps in modulator and demodulator, keeping track of data format and data size throughout all the processes of the whole simulation, designing an appropriate frame detector for the receiver, and debugging the MATLAB codes.

Chapter 4 showed and explained some analyses of the performance and characteristics of this simulated OFDM system.
